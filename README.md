# GeoEnergyMap
A geographic breakdown of state energy percentage. There were a shapefile, and a data file gathered from the EIA to gather the outlines of the shapes, and associate energy generation data with each state to the mapping respectively.
The three most used packages were the GeoPandas, Numpy, and the MatPlotLib. A new environment was created in Anaconda, and we went from there.
